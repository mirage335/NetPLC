Important: Execute gschem and pcb from this folder when opening files. Otherwise, custom symbols and footprints will not be found.

Use the command "gsch2pcb project" to generate the pcb files from schematics. Where "project" is "NetPLC".

Bulk copper should be grounded. Otherwise, the extra copper will float, degrading noise rejection and phase margins.

Scripts provided in "production" directory as a git submodule may be used to generate BOMs, CAD models, photolithography assets, and third-party fabrication documentation. See README there for details.

Reference PCB layouts for subsystems may be renamed for use in master layout with sed.
