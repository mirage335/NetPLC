Advanced multi-peripherial low-power Networked Programmable Logic Controller (NetPLC) core platform.

__Usage__
General Purpose and Precision Analog RJ45 jacks may be used to attach attach additional microcontrollers, cameras, thermistors, pressure sensors, current/voltage transformers, power transistors, relays, etc.

Ethernet jack is provided for full 10BaseT support. WiFi support is also provided via RN171 module. Headers are provided for preassembled pin-compatible Ethernet and WiFi peripherials.

__Design__

Layout is important. Digital circuits create a multitude of full-swing square waves at radio frequency. Stray coupling of these transients into analog circuits can introduce both low and high frequency noise through a variety of mechanisms.

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.

__Extras__
Any isolated USB charger can be used as a power source. For example, consider http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Power-Adapter-Detachable-Micro/dp/B0089VO7FQ/ref=sr_1_6?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1415386782&sr=1-6&keywords=usb+power .

Typical 1/16" PCBs will not be thick enough to ensure reliable USB port contact. Consider adding a few layers of electrical or duct tape to the back side.
