_refreshAll.sh_
Searches for all production asset generation scripts, and executes them. Note this may be used at a higher-level to refresh multiple gEDA projects at once.

_BillOfMaterials_
Bill of Materials can be generated in HTML format. Use the description attribute for parts, with the following format:
X $12.34 MOUSER 123-456789

Components with "X" at the front of their description make the circuit slightly more robust, and may be excluded. However, circuit boards should be manufactured with room for them, should they prove necessary.

LibreOffice Calc (spreadsheet) can take an HTML copy/pasted from a web browser. From there, prices can be added after stripping extraneous description information with the following regex: \ [^0-9].*

_CAD_
Generates DXF and PNG files for modeling in mechanical CAD assemblies.

_hacdcCNC/Photolithography_
G-Code and lithography masks for self-fabricating high-quality PCBs, ideally with access to HacDC's CNC mill and supplies.

_oshpark/stencil_
Upload these to quickly order high-quality PCBs and solder-paste stencils fabricated by a third-party service cost-effectively.
